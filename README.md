Garden Planner is an app that users can use to plan their vegetable garden before planting.  It also has some useful information about commonly planted vegetables.

## Technologies used are Heroku, Express, Node, MongoDB, and Moongoose.

### Dependencies installed include: 

npm i bcrypt

npm i react-router-dom

npm i dotenv

npm i moongoose

npm i express morgan serve-favicon

npm i esm

npm i react-dnd-html5-backend

npm i react-dnd


Just type the above codes into your terminal and you're good to go. 

### Hurdles include:  The animations and the sound player were tough.  It was initially a challenge to set up the garden the way I wanted it.  Also making sure the code was as DRY as possible. Inputting data was time consuming, and using it was occasionally tricky.

## Icebox items include: Adding more features, and more plants.  Updating the buttons.  Updating the bees.  Adding the ability to save garden plans for future use. CSS is not as DRY as I would like it.
